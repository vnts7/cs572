Q1:
The main advantage to using setImmediate() over setTimeout() 
is setImmediate() will always be executed before any timers 
if scheduled within an I/O cycle, independently of how many timers are present.
Q2:
process.nextTick() is in highest priority queue while setImmediate is in event queue. 
It mean everything in nextTick() will be executed at very first and of course before setImmediate
Q2:
